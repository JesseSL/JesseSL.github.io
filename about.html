                <h2>Here I Come</h2>
                <p>
                    Born on January 10th, 1998, in Cork General Hospital, County Cork, Ireland. Four years the younger to my brother Luke, I am one of two boys to our mother and father.

                <h2>The Childhood Years</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in the south west of Ireland by the ocean in County Kerry. Growing up, I played every sport available to me, attended Ardfert National School, and spent summers with my grandparents and cousins.

                <h2>The Teenage Years</h2>
                <p>
                    Began High School at Mercy Mounthawk Secondary School, Tralee, Co. Kerry, Ireland. During this time, I had some major sporting achievements, including captaining the Republic of Ireland U16 in soccer, as well as making appearances with the National Team from U15 to U17. Through soccer, I have traveled around Europe, Asia, and North America. Graduated high school in May 2016.

                <h2>A Big Change</h2>
                <p>
                    In April 2016, I accepted a scholarship from the <a href="https://www.evansville.edu/" target="_blank">University of Evansville</a> (NCAA D1) to play soccer with the Purple Aces. Four months later, I took this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and moved to Indiana, having never been there or not met anyone from there.

                <h2>The College Years</h2>
                <p>
                    Earned a B.S in Sports Communication with a 3.76 GPA in my four years. During that period, I had an incredible time playing for the <a href="https://gopurpleaces.com/sports/mens-soccer" target="_blank">Men's Soccer Team</a>, and had the honor of captaining the team for my junior and senior year. You can watch my highlight video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6zdj1lc-4Q" target="_blank">here</a>. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 in 2020, my class never had our graduation.

                <h2>The Graduation & Covid Year</h2>
                <p>
                    June 2020, I began working for Perfleek, Inc. in Jasper, IN, as a Virtual Tours Specialist. I was relocated to Orlando, FL for five months, shooting, editing, and producing virtual tours for our vacation rental company. The timing actually worked perfectly for me as my job required me to travel to vacation units, which would usually be full of vacationers, but due to covid, they were all empty. I was one of the lucky ones who still went about their regular day-today jobs.

                <h2>The Postgraduate Years</h2>
                <p>
                    After one year at Perfleek, I decided to go back to school and get my masters. I enrolled in the MBA program at Cumberland University and moved from Indiana to Tennessee. Along with my degree, I became the Graduate Assistant for the Men's Soccer Team at the University.

                <h2>Preparing for the Second Graduation</h2>
                <p>
                    In January 2023, I enrolled in ZTM: Complete Web Mastery, to back up my undergraduate degree, my soon to have masters degree, and a continuation of my pure enjoyment of web development.

                <h2>The Future Years</h2>
                <p>
                    As I begin my career, I want to break into the tech world and eventually a front-end developer. I want to learn from people in the industry and succeed as a self-taught developer. I vouch to myself to put in the necessary work to find a job that I can enjoy and make a big positive impact in upon graduation in May.<br> <br>Who knows? We will see what happens, but I will keep working hard to achieve my goals and still have fun with my family and friends.
