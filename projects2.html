			<h2>Rose Imaging</h2>

			<h2>Perfleek, Inc. Blog</h2>
			<p>While at Perfleek, I was given the reins to create a blog website for the company. The aim of the blog was to engage customers by increasing awareness and knowledge throughout the entire buy, sell, and rental process. Real Estate and Vacation Rentals can be extremely stressful and our hope was to give confidence to people during this stressful time.</p>

			<h2>Valentia Island Transatlantic Cable</h2>
			<p>As a contributor to the website, the Valentia Island Transatlantic Cable website is an extremely exciting project. The ultimate goal is to drive traffic to buy tours of the new state of the art Cable Station, the "Eigth Wonder of the World". The story of Valentia Island, which sits off the west coast of ireland, started over 150 years ago when the first transatlantic message was sent by cable from Europe to America. This reduced messaging time from weeks to mere minutes.</p>

			<h2>Vacation Rental Virtual Tours</h2>
			<p>Not a web project, but a wonderful use of Matterport technology to create virtual tours of vacation rentals and real estate listings. We produced these tours for Perfleek during Covid, greatly enhancing customer experiences, allowing them to see every inch of rentals and listings without having to visit them in person.</p>
