<p>My journey has been full of twists and turns, bringing me to a destination I couldn't have imagined when I moved to the US in 2016. With two degrees, an MBA from Cumberland University and a B.S in Sports Communication from the University of Evansville, I find myself searching for my next steps in my career.</p>

<p>The ability to create content from scratch is exciting to me. Hopping on my laptop every day provides me with the opportunity to be creative and to continue to add to my web design experience and business education. Web design and web development is very complex and follows rigid structure, but allows the freedom of creativity within those structures.</p>

<p>Combining these skills with a career in business lends itself many opportunities with the continued reliance on technology in our world. I look forward to learning from experienced professionals who have experience in both areas, with the hope of one day owning my own web development company</p>

<p>Until then, I'll be here typing away.</p>
